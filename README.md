## 🎨 **Features**

- **Retro Design** 🖼️: Styled with vintage-inspired elements, smooth animations, and shadows for a unique aesthetic.
- **Dynamic Calculation History** 📜: Each calculation generates a "punched card" with the result, simulating historical data storage methods.
- **Interactive Help Icon** ❓: Offers a guide on the engine’s logic and calculation methods.
